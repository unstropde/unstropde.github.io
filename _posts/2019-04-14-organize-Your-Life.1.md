        Tart Dough (aka "Please Don't Fall Apart On Me"):
        220g flour (I used whole wheat) <br><br>
        110g cold butter, cubed <br><br>
        1/2 tsp salt <br><br>
        1/2 tsp Italian seasoning <br><br>
        1 large egg <br><br>
        2-3 tbsp cold water <br><br>
        The Tomato <br><br>
        3 large tomatoes <br><br>
        1 tsp brown sugar <br><br>
        150g Parmesan cheese <br><br>
        1 egg <br><br>
        salt and pepper <br><br>
    </td>
    <td style="text-align: left;width: 60%;vertical-align: top;">
      Mix the flour, salt, and Italian seasoning. Add the butter and pretend you're a pastry chef while you crumble it with your hands (or a pastry blender if you're not into the whole "butter under my fingernails" aesthetic). Add the egg and water, stir until it looks like it might actually hold together, then let it chill it in the fridge for 30 minutes while you contemplate your life choices.<br><br>
      Slice the tomatoes, toss with a pinch of sugar, and let them sit for 30 minutes, they’ll release The excess water. Drain them and pat them dry with paper towels – think of it as tomato therapy.<br><br>
      Assembly: Where Magic Happens (Or Doesn't) <br><br>
      Preheat your oven to 200°C and roll out that dough on a baking sheet. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese, leaving a 3cm border (because even galettes need personal space). Arrange the drained tomatoes on top, add salt and pepper, then fold the edges over like you're tucking them into bed.<br><br>
      Brush the crust with egg wash and add more Parmesan because cheese makes everything better.<br><br>

The Verdict
Twenty minutes later, you'll have something that looks like it came from a fancy French café. The tomatoes will be sweet and jammy, the crust will be flaky, and you'll feel like you've accomplished something meaningful.
Plus, if it looks wonky, just call it "rustic" and charge extra.
Bon appétit!
